    <h1>Arsenal London FC</h1>
    <p>Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. It has won 13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, two League Cups, the League Centenary Trophy, 15 FA Community Shields, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Arsenal fans often refer to themselves as "Gooners", the name derived from the team's nickname, "The Gunners". The fanbase is large, generally loyal, and virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007â€“08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity) and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance.</p>
